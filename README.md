## ✨ What's New in v3.3 — HOPE Engine Edition

- **🔮 HOPE Engine** — Standing-instruction layer. Tell an agent something once from Slack and it acts autonomously every time, forever, until you cancel: _"Whenever you detect breaking war news, alert me immediately"_
- **📋 Per-Agent Companion Files** — OpenClaw-style `HOPE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `IDENTITY.md` auto-created per agent in `memory/agents/{slug}/`
- **🔇 Mute Hours + Rate Limiting** — Quiet hours (23:00–07:00) suppress non-CRITICAL alerts. 10 alerts/hour cap for NORMAL/HIGH. CRITICAL always fires
- **📬 4th Gateway Routing Tier** — HOPE intent detection intercepts standing-instruction phrases (`whenever`, `alert me if`, `watch for`, `stop watching`, `list my rules`) before LLM fallback
- **👤 UserProfile** — `memory/system/USER.md` maps alert priority to Slack channels (DM / #breaking-alerts / #media-alerts / digest)
- **4 new HOPE_* settings** — `HOPE_ENABLED`, `HOPE_MAX_ALERTS_PER_HOUR`, `HOPE_MUTE_START_HOUR`, `HOPE_MUTE_END_HOUR`
- **3 new slash commands** — `/miq-hope`, `/miq-hope-cancel`, `/miq-hope-list`

## ✨ What's New in v3.2 — Persistent Agent Memory Edition

- **🧠 Persistent Agent Memory** — Every agent now accumulates knowledge across runs. Per-agent `.md` log files track decisions, durations, inputs, outputs, and triggered events
- **📋 Inter-Agent Event Log** — `inter_agent_comms.md` captures every cross-agent event with source, subscribers, and payload summaries
- **📜 Global Task History** — `task_history.md` maintains a compact audit trail of every task across all 19 agents
- **🗂️ System State Snapshots** — `system_state.md` is fully rewritten every 5 minutes with queue size, agent registry, job schedules, and recent task history
- **🤖 LLM Context Injection** — `agent.get_memory_context_prompt()` surfaces the last N entries as a formatted system-prompt block for context-aware decisions
- **🔧 8 new MEMORY_* settings** — Fully configurable: max entries per file, trim thresholds, context window size, snapshot interval, all on by default with zero API key requirements

---

## ✨ What Was New in v3.1 — Pipeline + Channel Edition

- **🔌 Connector Framework** — MCP-style plugin architecture. Connect any external system as a tool agents can discover and call
- **💬 Slack & Teams Integration** — Trigger any agent directly from Slack (`/miq-compliance`) or Teams. Get interactive results with action buttons
- **🧠 Conversational Gateway** — NLP + slash commands. Natural language routing via Claude LLM with multi-turn conversation context
- **📥 Ingest & Transcode Agent** — Front-door of the broadcast pipeline. FFmpeg / AWS MediaConvert with 6 output profiles

## 🌐 The Global Shift to Agent-Native Workspaces

The broadcast industry — and every enterprise industry — is in the middle of the same transition that happened when the web replaced desktop software. Except this time, the shift is from **dashboard UIs** to **conversational agents living inside the tools people already use**.

### Why Slack (and Teams) as the Agent Interface is the Future

When a journalist types `@mediaagentiq is this clip a deepfake?` into Slack and gets a forensic result in four seconds with approve/reject buttons — they never left their workflow. They didn't open a new tab, log into a new tool, or learn a new UI. The agent came to them.

This is the **agent-native workspace** pattern, and it is accelerating rapidly across every industry:

| Platform | Agent Capability | Status (2026) |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Microsoft 365 Copilot | Agents embedded in Teams, Word, Excel | GA |
| Salesforce Agentforce | Autonomous CRM agents in Slack | GA |
| ServiceNow AI Agents | IT/HR workflow agents via chat | GA |
| Atlassian Rovo | Jira/Confluence agents with team context | GA |
| GitHub Copilot Workspace | Code agents triggered from Issues/PRs | GA |
| Google Workspace Duet AI | Docs/Meet agents with proactive alerts | GA |
| Slack itself (Bolt SDK) | First-class agent hosting platform | GA |

MediaAgentIQ is doing for broadcast operations what Copilot did for Office — but **three to five years before any incumbent broadcast vendor** (Vizrt, Grass Valley, Harmonic, Avid, Ross Video) has shipped anything comparable.

### The HOPE Pattern: Standing Instructions as the New Primitive

The HOPE Engine introduces what is rapidly becoming a first-class primitive in production AI systems: **standing instructions** — rules you set once that cause agents to act autonomously forever.

```
"Whenever a deepfake risk score exceeds 60%, hold the clip and alert me immediately"
→ This one sentence replaces: a cron job + a monitoring dashboard + a PagerDuty rule + a manual workflow
```

This pattern is appearing across the ecosystem:
- **Claude Code** has `CLAUDE.md` — persistent instructions that shape Claude's behaviour across every session
- **OpenAI Assistants API** stores `instructions` that persist across threads
- **LangGraph** and **AutoGen** implement "persistent agent state" for long-running autonomous tasks
- **Anthropic MCP** allows agents to persist tool relationships and context across invocations

HOPE is MediaAgentIQ's broadcast-domain implementation of the same idea. It transforms agents from tools you call into **colleagues who watch for things on your behalf**.

### What the Industry Analysts Are Saying

- **Gartner (2025):** By 2028, 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI — up from less than 1% in 2024.
- **McKinsey Global Institute (2025):** Agentic AI could automate 50–70% of time spent on repetitive knowledge work in media and communications.
- **IDC (2026):** The market for AI agent platforms will reach $47B by 2028, growing at 42% CAGR. Vertical-specific agents (media, finance, healthcare) will command 60% of that spend.
- **Forrester (2025):** "Enterprises that deploy agents inside existing collaboration platforms (Slack, Teams) see 3× faster adoption than those requiring separate dashboards."

The broadcast industry lags every other sector in AI adoption by roughly 3 years. The first vendors to build agent platforms purpose-built for broadcast will own the category.

## 🧠 Persistent Memory at Scale — What Happens When Memory Grows Large

Every agent in MediaAgentIQ writes to plain `.md` files. This is intentional — it makes memory human-readable, version-controllable with git, zero-dependency, and instantly inspectable. But `.md` files have a practical upper bound before they become slow to read and expensive to inject into LLM prompts.

Here is how the system is designed to handle growth at every scale:

### Current Safeguards (v3.2+)

```
MEMORY_MAX_ENTRIES_PER_AGENT=500    → trim trigger
MEMORY_TRIM_TO=400                  → entries kept after trim (oldest 100 removed)
MEMORY_INTER_AGENT_MAX_ENTRIES=2000 → inter_agent_comms.md cap
MEMORY_TASK_HISTORY_MAX_ENTRIES=5000→ global audit table cap
MEMORY_RECENT_CONTEXT_ENTRIES=5     → only last 5 entries injected into LLM prompts
```

This means a single agent's `MEMORY.md` stays under ~80KB indefinitely. At 19 agents running 14 scheduled jobs, the total memory footprint stabilises around **2–4 MB of text** — well within file-system performance limits.

### The Three-Tier Memory Architecture (Roadmap)

As the platform runs for months and years, raw trim-and-discard is not enough. Real institutional memory needs to be *preserved* and *made searchable*, not thrown away. The roadmap introduces three tiers:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Tier 1 — Hot Memory (current, in .md files)                   │
│  Last 400–500 entries per agent                                │
│  Injected directly into LLM prompts as system context          │
│  Read/write: <1ms                                              │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Tier 2 — Warm Memory (rolling 6 months, in SQLite / Postgres) │
│  Structured rows: agent, task_id, timestamp, outcome, tags     │
│  Queried by agent on demand ("what happened to brand safety    │
│  scores last month?")                                          │
│  Read: ~5ms full-table scan on local SQLite                    │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Tier 3 — Cold Memory (everything older, in S3 / archive)      │
│  YYYY-MM.md.gz per agent per month                             │
│  Retrievable via /miq-recall command or HOPE "remember" rule   │
│  Not injected into prompts unless explicitly recalled          │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Memory Distillation — The Critical Long-Term Strategy

Raw task logs grow indefinitely. The transformative capability is periodic **memory distillation** — using an LLM to compress 500 raw entries into a compact, high-signal summary that persists in `SOUL.md`:

```
Every Sunday at 03:00 UTC, the distillation job runs:
  1. Read last 500 entries from caption_agent/MEMORY.md
  2. Send to Claude: "Summarise the key patterns, failure modes, and
     lessons from these 500 broadcast caption tasks in ≤10 bullet points"
  3. Append the distilled summary to caption_agent/SOUL.md under
     "## Institutional Memory — [week of YYYY-MM-DD]"
  4. The raw 500 entries rotate to Tier 2 / archive
  5. Next week, the LLM has SOUL.md (distilled wisdom) + last 5 hot
     entries as context — more signal, less noise
```

This is exactly how human organisations build institutional knowledge: raw experience (task logs) → distilled lessons (SOUL.md) → cultural wisdom (IDENTITY.md). The agent becomes genuinely smarter over time, not just bigger in storage.

### Memory as a Competitive Moat

An agent platform that has been running for 12 months inside a broadcast organisation has seen:
- Every compliance edge case that network has encountered
- Every brand safety override decision and why it was made
- Every deepfake false positive and the signal patterns that caused them
- Every breaking-news rundown change and how the Production Director responded

That accumulated, distilled, structured memory is **not replaceable by a competitor installing a fresh agent platform**. It is the institutional knowledge of the broadcast operation, held by the agents. This is why persistent memory is not a feature — it is the long-term strategic moat of the platform.

### Practical File Size Reference

| File | Growth rate | Size at 6 months | Size at 2 years |
|------|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Per-agent MEMORY.md (trimmed) | ~80KB steady state | ~80KB | ~80KB |
| task_history.md (capped 5K rows) | ~500KB steady state | ~500KB | ~500KB |
| inter_agent_comms.md (capped 2K) | ~200KB steady state | ~200KB | ~200KB |
| SOUL.md (distilled weekly) | ~2KB/week added | ~50KB | ~200KB |
| Daily logs/ archive (per agent) | ~5KB/day | ~9MB/agent | ~36MB/agent |
| **Total platform memory footprint** | | **~175MB** | **~690MB** |

At two years of continuous operation, 690MB of structured broadcast knowledge — fully human-readable, git-versioned, and LLM-injectable — is a remarkably compact representation of an organisation's operational intelligence.

## 🔌 Connector Framework (MCP-Style)

The connector framework exposes external systems as tools that agents can discover and call — similar to MCP (Model Context Protocol).

```python
from connectors import connector_registry, setup_connectors

# Connect all channels at startup
await setup_connectors(demo_mode=True)

# Agent sends an alert via Slack
slack = connector_registry.get("slack")
await slack.send_alert("Signal Quality Critical", "Stream dropped", severity="critical")

# MCP-style tool call — agent doesn't need to know which connector handles it
result = await connector_registry.call_tool(
    "slack_send_message",
    {"channel": "#noc-alerts", "text": "Ingest job complete"}
)

# Discover all available tools (for LLM tool-use)
tools = connector_registry.get_all_tool_definitions()
```

**Available MCP Tools (v3.1):**
- `slack_send_message` — Send a Block Kit card to any Slack channel
- `slack_send_alert` — Send a severity-coded proactive alert
- `slack_read_channel` — Read recent messages from a channel
- `teams_send_message` — Send an Adaptive Card to Teams
- `teams_send_alert` — Send a proactive alert card to Teams

## 📈 Changelog

### v3.3.0 (Latest) — HOPE Engine Edition
- ✅ `memory/hope_engine.py` — `HopeRule` dataclass + `HopeEngine` class (add/cancel/list/evaluate/fire)
- ✅ `memory/user_profile.py` — `UserProfile` reads `memory/system/USER.md` for Slack channel routing
- ✅ `memory/system/USER.md` + `IDENTITY.md` — OpenClaw-style platform identity + user preference files
- ✅ Per-agent `memory/agents/{slug}/` subdirs — `HOPE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `logs/`
- ✅ `BaseAgent`: HOPE init + post-`process()` evaluation hook + `add/cancel/list_hope_rules()` methods
- ✅ 4th gateway routing tier — HOPE intent detection (9 trigger phrases) before LLM fallback
- ✅ `format_hope_created/cancelled/list/alert()` Slack Block Kit formatters (CRITICAL = `<!here>` + bold)
- ✅ Mute hours (23:00–07:00), CRITICAL bypasses mute; 10 alerts/hour rate limit per agent
- ✅ 3 new slash commands: `/miq-hope`, `/miq-hope-cancel`, `/miq-hope-list`
- ✅ 4 new `HOPE_*` settings in `settings.py`
- ✅ Failure-safe throughout: corrupt HOPE.md recreated from scratch; no exception propagates to agent

### v3.2.0 — Persistent Agent Memory Edition
- ✅ `memory/` Python package — `AgentMemoryLayer` class with per-agent `.md` log files
- ✅ Per-agent memory: entries/success rate/avg duration tracked in live header; auto-trim at configurable limits
- ✅ `inter_agent_comms.md` — cross-agent event log with source, subscribers, payload summary
- ✅ `task_history.md` — global compact audit trail (markdown table, max 5 000 rows)
- ✅ `system_state.md` — orchestrator snapshot fully rewritten every 300 s
- ✅ `BaseAgent.get_memory_context_prompt()` — inject last N entries into any LLM system prompt
- ✅ 8 new `MEMORY_*` settings in `settings.py` (all defaults work out-of-the-box)
- ✅ Failure-safe: all memory I/O wrapped in `try/except`; agents continue if `memory/` is absent
- ✅ Orchestrator `_handle_task_completion` now returns triggered-event list + logs to inter-agent comms

### v3.1.0 — Pipeline + Channel Edition
- ✅ Conversational Gateway — NLP + slash command routing to all 19 agents
